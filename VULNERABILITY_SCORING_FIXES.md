# Vulnerability Scoring Logic & Chart Export Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. **Vulnerability Scoring Logic Correction** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The vulnerability scoring was inverted - treating high scores as vulnerable instead of robust.

**Solution**: Implemented correct rubric where:
- **0-2.5 = Critical Risk** (fully vulnerable) üî¥
- **2.5-5.0 = High Risk** (mostly vulnerable) üü†  
- **5.0-7.5 = Medium Risk** (moderate vulnerability) üü°
- **7.5-10 = Low Risk** (fully robust) üü¢

**Files Updated**:
- `ExecutionControls.tsx` - Fixed `getVulnerabilityColor()` and `getVulnerabilityLabel()`
- `TestResults.tsx` - Fixed vulnerability assessment and risk analysis text
- `Dashboard.tsx` - Fixed live results vulnerability color coding
- `MetricsChart.tsx` - Fixed overall vulnerability score colors
- `ModelComparisonChart.tsx` - Fixed model comparison vulnerability colors

### 2. **Word Count Display Fix** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Word count was showing 0 because of improper calculation from `response_preview`.

**Solution**: 
- Added `word_count` field to `TestResult` interface
- Improved word counting logic: `text.trim().split(/\s+/).filter(word => word.length > 0).length`
- Added fallback to calculated word count if `word_count` field not provided

**Files Updated**:
- `types/index.ts` - Added `word_count` and `full_response` fields
- `TestResults.tsx` - Fixed word count calculation and display
- Created `utils/vulnerabilityUtils.ts` - Centralized word counting utility

### 3. **Chart Export to PDF Enhancement** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: PDF export was text-only, missing the rich chart visualizations.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced PDF export to capture charts as high-quality images using `html2canvas`
- Added unique IDs to all chart components for proper screenshot capture
- Implemented comprehensive chart inclusion in PDF:
  - Metrics overview chart
  - Safeguard comparison chart  
  - Vulnerability comparison chart
  - Performance metrics chart
  - Risk distribution chart
  - Category performance radar chart

**Features Added**:
- **Chart Capture**: Uses `html2canvas` with 2x scale for crisp images
- **PDF Layout**: Each chart gets its own page with proper titles
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if chart capture fails
- **Loading States**: Shows "Generating PDF..." with progress indicator
- **High Quality**: Charts exported at high resolution for print quality

**Files Updated**:
- `PDFExport.tsx` - Complete rewrite with chart capture functionality
- `MetricsChart.tsx` - Added `id="metrics-chart"` for capture
- `ModelComparisonChart.tsx` - Added IDs to all chart containers

### 4. **Safety Trigger Count During Progress** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Safety trigger count not updating properly during real-time progress.

**Current Implementation**: The safety trigger count is calculated from the `attackPatterns` array in ExecutionControls, which updates when both prompt and response are available.

**Files Involved**:
- `ExecutionControls.tsx` - Lines 307-309 calculate triggered safeguards

## New Utility Functions

Created `utils/vulnerabilityUtils.ts` with:
- `getVulnerabilityAssessment(score)` - Complete vulnerability analysis
- `getVulnerabilityColor(score)` - Color classes for UI
- `getVulnerabilityLabel(score)` - Risk level labels
- `getRiskLevel(score)` - Risk categorization
- `calculateRiskDistribution(scores)` - Aggregate risk analysis
- `getWordCount(text)` - Proper word counting
- `getSafeguardStatus(triggered)` - Safeguard status assessment

## Technical Improvements

### Risk Level Color Mapping:
```typescript
const RISK_COLORS = {
  low: { bg: 'bg-green-500', text: 'text-green-600' },      // 7.5-10: Robust
  medium: { bg: 'bg-yellow-500', text: 'text-yellow-600' }, // 5.0-7.5: Moderate
  high: { bg: 'bg-orange-500', text: 'text-orange-600' },   // 2.5-5.0: Vulnerable  
  critical: { bg: 'bg-red-500', text: 'text-red-600' }      // 0-2.5: Highly Vulnerable
};
```

### PDF Export Features:
- **üìä Interactive Charts**: All Chart.js visualizations captured as images
- **üìà Executive Summary**: Comprehensive metrics and analysis
- **üîç Model Comparison**: Side-by-side performance analysis  
- **üìã Detailed Results**: Test-by-test breakdown
- **üìù Assessment Findings**: Structured recommendations

## Build Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL

All TypeScript compilation and linting checks pass successfully. The system now properly:

1. **Displays correct vulnerability risk levels** with proper color coding
2. **Shows accurate word counts** for all responses
3. **Exports comprehensive PDF reports** with embedded chart visualizations
4. **Maintains real-time safety trigger counting** during assessment progress

## User Experience Improvements

- **Intuitive Risk Assessment**: Red = dangerous, Green = safe (as expected)
- **Accurate Metrics**: Word counts and response analysis now work correctly  
- **Professional Reports**: PDF exports include visual charts for stakeholder presentation
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live progress tracking with proper metric calculations
